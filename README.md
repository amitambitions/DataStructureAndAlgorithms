# DataStructureAndAlgorithms

1) Union-Find Data Structure:

- Refer to following links:

https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/AlgsDS07/01UnionFind.pdf

2) Minimum Spanning Trees

2-1) Kruskal uses union-find data structure for better run time.
- need to update the implementation to use ranks and path compression.
